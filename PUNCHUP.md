# Punch-up proposal

## What is the work I'm taking on? Will it be a new entry, or an interesting interaction?
My punch-up will consist of two interactive components and technical refinements that elevate both the visual experience and the technical depth of my portfolio.
1. An interactive floating 3D can model on my can design page. The can will be rotatable and allow viewers to switch between different packaging textures.
2. A gravity-driven box on my Project 2 page. This container will hold various tech stack icons. The icons will be draggable and respond to scroll movement with inertia within the box.
3. I will build the entire portfolio using Tailwind CSS and adopt granular, consistent Git commit naming conventions. 

## How do I think this is going to enhance my body of work?
1. **Interactive 3D can:** It allows viewers to experience my design from all angles, rather than relying on static mockups.
2. **Gravity-driven Tech Stack Icons:** Long case studies often lose reader attention toward the end, especially when the Development section appears last and feels dense or highly technical. By adding this component, I aim to introduce a moment of playfulness that makes the technical content more engaging and approachable.
3. **Technical Refinements:** As I am pursuing developer-related roles and have not previously built a project using Tailwind CSS, applying Tailwind to my portfolio allows me to gain hands-on experience. Additionally, adopting granular and consistent Git commit naming conventions will help demonstrate structured development practices and highlight my technical discipline.

## Examples to help explain my concept
I have already built these components, and they can be viewed at the links below:

- [Gravity-driven Tech Stack Icons](https://wendellshiro.com/development/safespace#development-process:~:text=and%20user%20experience.-,A,-lightweight%20web%20supplement)

## Any resources I plan on using
- For the 3D can, I will use React Three Fiber, Blender, and Leva (for adjusting and debugging the can’s angles).
- For the gravity-driven icons, I will use Matter.js.

## Any fears, uncertainties, doubts about the implementation
- The display and motion behavior of the 3D can on the webpage may require iterative adjustment and refinement.
- Synchronizing scroll-based inertia with physics behavior in Matter.js may require experimentation and fine-tuning.
- Learning and applying Tailwind simultaneously may slow down development during the early stages of implementation.
